Okay so this tool is pretty basic all you need to do is run itenter a port number and run it to get your idps.bin

Extra Notes :
if your program freeses or it seems like it your ps3 and PC arnt conected 
i have setup the app so it will luanch on .Net4.0 For XP Users Too
i also setup idpstealer.exe as run as admin so you can see it running

IF All ELSE FAILS RESTART THE APP AND YOUR PC!!
