BwE NOR Validator - HTML Output Edition.

Created/Started by BwE on the 14th November 2012 (Because I was too lazy to constantly check everything).

Greetz/Credit: EussNL, Judges, No0bZiLLa, Rogero, Rebug, deank, 3absiso, AFP, SCE & PS3 Dev Wiki (+ Its Contributers).

=====================================================================================================================

This all in one validator/patcher will interpret the byte orientation, patch for 3.55/4.40 and will then output the results of 2800+ validations via HTML.

=====================================================================================================================

How?

1 - Place your .bin/s in the same folder as the validator.
2 - Run the validator and press Start.
3 - A console will appear asking you to select your dump (if you have more than one in the folder).
4 - Make your selection and or select if you watch to patch it (either in its current byte orientation or the opposite).
5 - Wait patiently.
6 - Press Enter at the end to launch the output.

=====================================================================================================================

Explanation

After selecting your dump and choosing which patch you want it will begin to process the validation. Once it is finished it will give you a brief count of the results, after this you simply press enter to exit.

The program will then open a html output illustrating everything that has been validated. Scroll through or use the menu at the top and read each section.

If a validation says 'warning' or 'danger' investigate it yourself manually using a hex editor, or contact somebody knowledgeable. Only corruption messages will show you the exact offset to look at, everything else won't so this is where you have to read/learn about it on the ps3devwiki.

Some validations will tell you that you need to patch it, if this is the case then do so and re-validate the patched dump.

If your dump has any 'danger' messages in the per console sections (find them in the menu) then there is a good chance its completely ruined and unfixable. Also, if your dump has a large amount of 'danger' messages then there is a serious issue - bad wiring can be discovered if you have any repetition in the dump.

Use at own risk! Valid dumps may be invalid - Invalid dumps may be valid. 
There are almost infinite variations of each dump! Have fun and good luck!
